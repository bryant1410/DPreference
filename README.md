### DPreference
If you have used SharePreference's MULTI_PROCESS_MODE, you may know that it's not reliable.

See the documentation of the [`SharedPreferences`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.html) you might have seen one of these warnings:
>Note: currently this class does not support use across multiple processes. This will be added later.

Google even deprecated the multiprocess support because it never worked relieable

DPreference is a way solving this problem powered by a ContentProvider. It works in multiple processed mode safely. You can declare your provider in a remote process, if you don't declare it in AndroidManifest.xml, it is operating in main process by default.

#### Features
- **works multiprocess safely**
- the same api like SharePreference
- compat old app versions, don't need to upgrade.
  DPreference is just a wrapper of original sharepreference with contentprovider.

#### Usage
```
       DPreference dPreference = new DPreference(context, "default");
       dPreference.setPrefString( "key", "value");

```
#### Compare With Tray(https://github.com/grandcentrix/tray/)
- **DPreference** 
    `setString` called 1000 times cost : 375 ms
    `getString` called 1000 times cost : 186 ms
- **Tray** 
    `setString` called 1000 times cost : 13699 ms 
    `getString` called 1000  times cost : 3496 ms

#### So DPreference has a better performance.
